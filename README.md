## About This App

"Secure Password Generator" is a web-app bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and `Typescript`. All styling / appearance is done using the `tailwindcss` utility framework as a base.

I built this web-app to improve my development skills, and also learn something new:

- More advanced ReactJS code / design principles
- How to use a global state manager like `Redux`
- How to create and style my own components - as a challenge to myself, I am using as little component libraries as I can
- Making a Progressive Web App or "PWA" to allow for offline use, and a downloadable experience
- Using a development pipeline - continuous integration and continuous deployment or "CI/CD" using Github workflows
- Bug / Issue management for a project
- Working with an Open-source project and getting assistance from a community
- Translating a project in an efficient way

In my opinion, all these things are important skills for a developer to have, and I figured the best way to learn and improve was to make something - so I made this.

The reason I built a password generator specifically was also about learning; Security and passwords are a very important aspect of development, and I figured making a password generator would be a good way to learn more about it.

This app is constantly being worked on and I am always open to ideas, suggestions, and collaborations!
